 ->To create an integer array,arr  of size n, int *arr = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int)), where arr  points to the base address of the array.
 The above array is a static array that has memory allocated at compile time. 
 To create an array in C, we can do int arr[n];. Here, arr, is a variable array which holds up to 10 integers.
->A dynamic array can be created in C, using the malloc function and the memory is allocated on the heap at runtime.
->An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type.
